# Stand Alone Installation (not recommended)
- For stand alone install on a Raspberry PI you need to first install nginx. If you already have Fluidd installed this shouldn't be needed.
- Install nginx. Then skip to below

# Fluidd based install (recommended)
From now on these instructions are assuming you are using Fluidd as the UI for Klipper/Moonraker. Eventually PrettyGCode will support other frontends like OctoPrint, Mainsail, DWC etc. 
- First log into your Raspberry PI via telent or tty.
- Clone repo into /home/pi/
```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/Kragrathea/pgcode.git
```

Config nginx server for a new website called "pgcode" on port 7136
- Copy the nginx config file from the pgcode directory to the nginx sites directory
```
sudo cp ~/pgcode/pgcode.local.conf /etc/nginx/sites-available/pgcode.local.conf
```
Nginx config file should look like this.
```
server {
     listen 7136;
     listen [::]:7136;
     server_name pgcode.local;

     root /home/pi/pgcode;

     index pgcode.html;

     location / {
          try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
     }
}
```
- Sanity check. This should display any config errors
```
sudo nginx -t -c /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```

- Enable site by making symbolic link
```
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/pgcode.local.conf  /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/pgcode.local.conf
```

- Restart nginx
```
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```
- Default port is 7136. 

- You may have to enable [octoprint_compat] in moonraker.conf file. 

# Connecting to Fluidd/Moonraker

Assuming you installed on a machine with a local name of "fluiddpi" you can access the PrettyGCode page by using this url. 

http://fluiddpi.local:7136 <-Should automatically connect to the local instance of Fluidd

If you installed to some other machine subsititute the ip address or name.

The above URL should take you to the PrettyGCode home page.  If Fluidd or Moonraker (or OctoPrint) is installed on the same machine code will attempt to detect the server type and should automatically connect. If your server is located on another machine or isn't being detected you can specifiy it on the command line like this:

http://fluiddpi.local:7136?server=http://fluiddpi.local:7125 <-Connect to the local instance of Moonraker (port 7125 by default)

or.

http://pgcode url:7136?server=http:// moonraker machine url:port

NOTE: For now URLS must be in the format http://servername:port without any trailing path info.


# Moonraker config
Depending on your setup you may have to edit Moonraker.conf to allow access. Check that the machine you are browsing from is included in the cors_domains and/or trusted_clients sections. You may also have to turn on octoprint_compat

Partial moonraker.conf
```
[authorization]
enabled: True
cors_domains:
  *.local
  *.lan
  *://app.fluidd.xyz
  *

trusted_clients:
    10.0.0.0/8
    127.0.0.0/8
    169.254.0.0/16
    172.16.0.0/12
    192.168.0.0/16
    192.168.1.0/160
    FE80::/10
    ::1/128

# enables support for slicer uploads via partial Octoprint API impl
[octoprint_compat]
```
# Fluidd config
If you haven't already you may have to enable SD support in Fluidd

Partial Fluidd client.cfg
```
[virtual_sdcard]
path: ~/gcode_files
```

# Troubleshooting connections
For now to trouble shoot the connection you need to open the browsers developer console and look for warnings in the console.

You may have to enable [octoprint_compat] in moonraker.conf file.
